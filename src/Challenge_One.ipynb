    "### Description: \n",
    "In this iQuHack, we will work on improving the given QAOA implemntation for solving the Max-Cut problem. We will test and implement more sophisticated optimization strategies such as COBYLA and SPSA to see if they can improve the performance of the given implementation. The project will involve coding and testing in Python using networkx and open-source libraries. By the end, we will have a better understanding of the performance of QAOA and a working implementation using advanced optimization strategies."
