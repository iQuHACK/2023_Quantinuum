# Benchmarking our algorithm for different parameters

There are 4 parameters which you can tune to get a different result evert time. 

Those are:

**G** = the input graph itself.


**shots** = number of shots.


**tol** = Tolerance for COBYLA minimizer.


**p** = Number of iterations of Alternating Unitaries.

In each of the following trials, we modified the input graph (**G**) and the number of iterations of alternating unitaries (**p**).
We held shots and tol constant in this trial, however we think that these would be interesting parameteres to tune in the future.
