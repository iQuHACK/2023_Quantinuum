    "# The Traveling Salesman Problem and Designing QUBOs for use with QAOA\n",
    "\n",
    "QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) is an excellent case study in the use of quantum hardware for solving approximation algorithms.  In principle, QAOA is able to solve all Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, however encoding the Hamiltonian may be challenging depending upon the QUBO parameters.  This summary article will provide an overview of creating QUBOs for use with QAOA with a focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem.  We also include some helpful resources for learning about QAOAs, Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs), and QUBOs."

    "As the name suggests, Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are a specific case of [quadratic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming) problem.  Specifically, these problems have no constraints on the optimization solution (Unconstrained) and the problems optimize a binary vector (Binary).  "
