    "# Carls' Implementation of QAOA using PytKet and COBAYLA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### QAOA and VQE Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "QAOA is a specific example of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).  All VQEs aim to find the ground state of a Hamiltonion, which can then be used for tasks such as optimization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These systems function as a feedback loop between a classical and quantum system.  Our classical system is a form of function optimization algorithm (Think Gradient Descent) while our quantum system implements our problem statement. In a VQE (and by extension, in a QAOA), we treat a quantum system as the function which we wish to minimze with the classical optimization algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing the Quantum System\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the quantum system is to find the ground state of some target Hamiltonion.  We do this by employing the Adiabatic theorem.  This theorem states that if we originate in the ground state of some Hamiltonion, then transition slowly enough (i.e. over enough time steps) to eventually reach our target state, we will now be in the ground state of our target Hamiltonion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the ground state of our target Hamiltonion, we first start in a system with a known ground state.  This is generally the result of a n dimensional Hadamard $H^{\\otimes n}$.  We then apply an alternating series of parametric 'Problem' and parametric 'Mixing' Circuits.  The problem circuits encode the target Hamiltonion while the mixing circuit are used to introduce rotations in a different orientation to the problem circuits.  Each repetition is parametarized by its own parameter, denoted $\\gamma_i$ and $\\beta_i$ for problem circuit $i$ and mixing circuit $i$.  In total, this series is paramaterized by a length $p$ vector $\\gamma = (\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, ... \\gamma_p)$ and length $p$ vector $\\beta = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p)$.  This decomposition of our target Hamiltonion into an alternating sequence of operators is known as Totterization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrating Quantum and Classical\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration $i$ of our classical solver, we instantiate a new instance of our quantum system.  We then calculate the expectation value of our target Hamiltonion using our state vector.  Note that we must run a number of shots on the quantum system before we can get an good estimate for the expecation value.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we pass the expectation value into our classical solver, which then updates $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.  This repeats until a stopping criteria for the classical solver (set by the user) is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a QAOA solver in Qiskit and integrate it with Quantinuum's pytket.  Furthermore, we integrate our quantum program with the COBYLA classical optimization algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our original goal was to extend our QAOA system to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.  This would enable us to iterface our QAOA with our custom designed search and rescue app.  This would demonstrate the possiblity for search and rescue teams to leverage quantum computation in order to more efficently plan their serach missions. As can be seen in our writeup, `QUBO_Traveling_Salesman_Overview`, we were able to create a cost function for Traveling Salesman and had the theoretical means to convert it to an appropriate Quantum Circuit.  However, we were unable to implement this as a Quantum Circuit and connect it to our graphical interface.  \n",
