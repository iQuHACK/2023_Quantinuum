# Carls-QSearch App
(Quack 23 Quantinium Team 37)

# About
Qsearch is an app made for search and rescues team to find the optimal route to search. We have a maximum of four nodes or search zones and utilize aws to push the array to be run on a quantum computer(quantum simulation). Once the computer locates the optimal route in a 1x16 array. Unfortunatly the translation has not been finalized do a to the time constraints. QSearch is a derivitave of Micah's Previous app CleverCart. The Infastructure was heavily used, but was not the source of the main app functionality. In src/home.js, one can find most of the operability and newly written code for this hackathon.

# Reasoning/Why
Our main purpose was to demonstrate that a user would be able to interact with a quantum algorithm in a simple way. We were not able to properly demonstrate the complete ability for one user to use a quantum algorithm, but we where succesful in demonstrating that quantum computing can be applied in a usefull, user-friendly way that is unitimdating and maskes itself within a regular problem.
